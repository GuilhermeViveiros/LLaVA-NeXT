But the advent of sonar had \nchanged everything. For the first time, ships could “sound out” the precise depths of the \nocean below them. For five years, Tharp’s colleagues at Columbia University had been \ncrisscrossing the Atlantic, recording its depths. Women weren’t allowed on these research\n(line 10) trips—the lab director considered them bad luck at sea—so Tharp wasn’t on board. Instead, \nshe stayed in the lab, meticulously checking and plotting the ships’ raw findings, a mass of \ndata so large it was printed on a 5,000-foot scroll. As she charted the measurements by hand \non sheets of white linen, the floor of the ocean slowly took shape before her.\n   Tharp spent weeks creating a series of six parallel profiles of the Atlantic floor stretching \n(line 15) from east to west. Her drawings showed—for the first time—exactly where the continental \nshelf began to rise out of the abyssal plain (abyssal plain -the flat sea floor at a depth of 10,000 to 20,000 feet, generally adjacent to a continent) and where a large mountain range jutted from \nthe ocean floor. That range had been a shock when it was discovered in the 1870s by an \nexpedition testing routes for transatlantic telegraph cables, and it had remained the subject \nof speculation since; Tharp’s charting revealed its length and detail. \n(line 20)   Her maps also showed something else—something no one expected. Repeating in each \nwas “a deep notch near the crest of the ridge,” a V-shaped gap that seemed to run the entire \nlength of the mountain range. Tharp stared at it. It had to be a mistake.\n   She crunched and re-crunched the numbers for weeks on end, double- and triple-\nchecking her data. As she did, she became more convinced that the impossible was true:\n(line 25) She was looking at evidence of a rift valley, a place where magma emerged from inside the \nearth, forming new crust and thrusting the land apart. If her calculations were right, the \ngeosciences would never be the same. \n   A few decades before, a German geologist named Alfred Wegener had put forward \nthe radical theory that the continents of the earth had once been connected and had drifted\n(line 30) apart. In 1926, at a gathering of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, \nthe scientists in attendance rejected Wegener’s theory and mocked its maker. No force on \nEarth was thought powerful enough to move continents. “The dream of a great poet,” \nopined (opined -declared)  the director of the Geological Survey of France: “One tries to embrace it, and finds \nthat he has in his arms a little vapor or smoke.” Later, the president of the American\n(line 35) Philosophical Society deemed it “utter, damned rot!” \n   In the 1950s, as Tharp looked down at that tell-tale valley, Wegener’s theory was still \nconsidered verboten (verboten - forbidden) in the scientific community—even discussing it was tantamount to \nheresy. (tantamount to heresy - unacceptable) Almost all of Tharp’s colleagues, and practically every other scientist in the country, \ndismissed it; you could get fired for believing in it, she later recalled. \n(line 40)   But Tharp trusted what she’d seen. Though her job at Columbia was simply to plot and \nchart measurements, she had more training in geology than most plotters—more, in fact, \nthan some of the men she reported to. Tharp had grown up among rocks. Her father \nworked for the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, and as a child, she would accompany him as \nhe collected samples. But she never expected to be a mapmaker or even a scientist. At the\n(line 45) time, the fields didn’t welcome women, so her first majors were music and English. After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women. There, Tharp \nbecame particularly fascinated with geomorphology, (geomorphology - the study of the physical features of the surfaces of the earth) devouring textbooks on how \nlandscapes form. A rock formation’s structure, composition, and location could tell you all \nsorts of things if you knew how to look at it.\n(line 55)    Studying the crack in the ocean floor, Tharp could see it was too large, too contiguous, (contiguous - near)\nto be anything but a rift valley, a place where two masses of land had separated. When she \ncompared it to a rift valley in Africa, she grew more certain. But when she showed Bruce \nHeezen, her research supervisor (four years her junior), “he groaned and said, ‘It cannot be. \nIt looks too much like continental drift,’ ” Tharp wrote later. “Bruce initially dismissed my\n(line 60) interpretation of the profiles as ‘girl talk.’ ” With the lab’s reputation on the line, Heezen \nordered her to redo the map. Tharp went back to the data and started plotting again from \nscratch. … \n   In late 1952, as Tharp was replotting the ocean floor, Heezen took on another deep-sea \nproject searching for safe places to plant transatlantic cables. He was creating his own map,\n(line 65) which plotted earthquake epicenters in the ocean floor. As his calculations accumulated, \nhe noticed something strange: Most quakes occurred in a nearly continuous line that sliced \ndown the center of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tharp had finished her second map— \na physiographic diagram giving the ocean floor a 3-D appearance—and sure enough, \nit showed the rift again. When Heezen and Tharp laid their two maps on top of each other\n(line 70) on a light table, both were stunned by how neatly the maps fit. The earthquake line \nthreaded right through Tharp’s valley. \n   They moved on from the Atlantic and began analyzing data from other oceans and other \nexpeditions, but the pattern kept repeating. They found additional mountain ranges, \nall seemingly connected and all split by rift valleys; within all of them, they found patterns\n(line 75) of earthquakes. “There was but one conclusion,” Tharp wrote. “The mountain range with \nits central valley was more or less a continuous feature across the face of the earth.” \nThe matter of whether their findings offered evidence of continental drift kept the pair \nsparring, but there was no denying they had made a monumental discovery: the mid-ocean \nridge, a 40,000-mile underwater mountain range that wraps around the globe like the seams \n(line 80) on a baseball. It’s the largest single geographical feature on the planet. …\n   By 1961, the idea that she’d put forward nearly a decade before—that the rift in the \nMid-Atlantic Ridge had been caused by land masses pulling apart—had finally reached \nwidespread acceptance. The National Geographic Society commissioned Tharp and \nHeezen to make maps of the ocean floor and its features, helping laypeople (laypeople -non-scientists) visualize the \n(line 85) vast plates that allowed the earth’s crust to move. Throughout the 1960s, a slew of \ndiscoveries helped ideas such as seafloor spreading and plate tectonics gain acceptance, \nbringing with them a cascade of new theories about the way the planet and life on it had \nevolved. Tharp compared the collective eye-opening to the Copernican revolution. \n“Scientists and the general public,” she wrote, “got their first relatively realistic image of a\n(line 90) vast part of the planet that they could never see.” … \n\n—Brooke Jarvis \nexcerpted from “A Crack in the World” \nMental Floss, December 2014"], "answer_text": "2", "options": ["(1) reveal Tharp’s vivid imagination", "(2) explain the nature of Tharp’s work", "(3) establish Tharp’s controversial views", "(4) illustrate a flaw in Tharp’s methodology"], "language": "english", "level": "high", "subject": "english", "subject_category": "language", "year": "2022", "id": 79}, "target": "2", "arguments": {"0": "max_new_tokens", "1": "temperature", "2": "top_p", "3": "num_beams", "4": "do_sample", "5": "image_sizes"}, "resps": [["The opening paragraph serves to (B) explain the nature of Tharp's"]], "filtered_resps": ["The opening paragraph serves to (B) explain the nature of Tharp's"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "c3f5ade0bc18a5157f7c3c1ca4e11ebe56f6aca9eb9935c0ab0a64d3294f89fd", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "m3exam": {"language": "english", "origin_response": "The opening paragraph serves to (B) explain the nature of Tharp's", "answer_text": "B", "origin_answer": "2", "standardized_answer": "B"}, "input": "The following is a multiple choice question about English.

Though her job at Columbia was simply to plot and \nchart measurements, she had more training in geology than most plotters—more, in fact, \nthan some of the men she reported to.

But she never expected to be a mapmaker or even a scientist. At the\n(line 45) time, the fields didn’t welcome women, so her first majors were music and English. After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women.

A rock formation’s structure, composition, and location could tell you all \nsorts of things if you knew how to look at it.\n(line 55)    Studying the crack in the ocean floor, Tharp could see it was too large, too contiguous, (contiguous - near)\nto be anything but a rift valley, a place where two masses of land had separated. When she \ncompared it to a rift valley in Africa, she grew more certain. But when she showed Bruce \nHeezen, her research supervisor (four years her junior), “he groaned and said, ‘It cannot be. \nIt looks too much like continental drift,’ ” Tharp wrote later. “Bruce initially dismissed my\n(line 60) interpretation of the profiles as ‘girl talk.’ ” With the lab’s reputation on the line, Heezen \nordered her to redo the map.

No force on \nEarth was thought powerful enough to move continents. “The dream of a great poet,” \nopined (opined -declared)  the director of the Geological Survey of France: “One tries to embrace it, and finds \nthat he has in his arms a little vapor or smoke.” Later, the president of the American\n(line 35) Philosophical Society deemed it “utter, damned rot!” \n   In the 1950s, as Tharp looked down at that tell-tale valley, Wegener’s theory was still \nconsidered verboten (verboten - forbidden) in the scientific community—even discussing it was tantamount to \nheresy. (tantamount to heresy - unacceptable) Almost all of Tharp’s colleagues, and practically every other scientist in the country, \ndismissed it; you could get fired for believing in it, she later recalled. \n(line 40)   But Tharp trusted what she’d seen. Though her job at Columbia was simply to plot and \nchart measurements, she had more training in geology than most plotters—more, in fact, \nthan some of the men she reported to. Tharp had grown up among rocks. Her father \nworked for the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, and as a child, she would accompany him as \nhe collected samples. But she never expected to be a mapmaker or even a scientist. At the\n(line 45) time, the fields didn’t welcome women, so her first majors were music and English. After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women. There, Tharp \nbecame particularly fascinated with geomorphology, (geomorphology - the study of the physical features of the surfaces of the earth) devouring textbooks on how \nlandscapes form. A rock formation’s structure, composition, and location could tell you all \nsorts of things if you knew how to look at it.\n(line 55)    Studying the crack in the ocean floor, Tharp could see it was too large, too contiguous, (contiguous - near)\nto be anything but a rift valley, a place where two masses of land had separated. When she \ncompared it to a rift valley in Africa, she grew more certain. But when she showed Bruce \nHeezen, her research supervisor (four years her junior), “he groaned and said, ‘It cannot be. \nIt looks too much like continental drift,’ ” Tharp wrote later. “Bruce initially dismissed my\n(line 60) interpretation of the profiles as ‘girl talk.’ ” With the lab’s reputation on the line, Heezen \nordered her to redo the map. Tharp went back to the data and started plotting again from \nscratch. … \n   In late 1952, as Tharp was replotting the ocean floor, Heezen took on another deep-sea \nproject searching for safe places to plant transatlantic cables. He was creating his own map,\n(line 65) which plotted earthquake epicenters in the ocean floor. As his calculations accumulated, \nhe noticed something strange: Most quakes occurred in a nearly continuous line that sliced \ndown the center of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tharp had finished her second map— \na physiographic diagram giving the ocean floor a 3-D appearance—and sure enough, \nit showed the rift again. When Heezen and Tharp laid their two maps on top of each other\n(line 70) on a light table, both were stunned by how neatly the maps fit. The earthquake line \nthreaded right through Tharp’s valley. \n   They moved on from the Atlantic and began analyzing data from other oceans and other \nexpeditions, but the pattern kept repeating. They found additional mountain ranges, \nall seemingly connected and all split by rift valleys; within all of them, they found patterns\n(line 75) of earthquakes. “There was but one conclusion,” Tharp wrote. “The mountain range with \nits central valley was more or less a continuous feature across the face of the earth.” \nThe matter of whether their findings offered evidence of continental drift kept the pair \nsparring, but there was no denying they had made a monumental discovery: the mid-ocean \nridge, a 40,000-mile underwater mountain range that wraps around the globe like the seams \n(line 80) on a baseball.

Though her job at Columbia was simply to plot and \nchart measurements, she had more training in geology than most plotters—more, in fact, \nthan some of the men she reported to. Tharp had grown up among rocks. Her father \nworked for the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, and as a child, she would accompany him as \nhe collected samples. But she never expected to be a mapmaker or even a scientist. At the\n(line 45) time, the fields didn’t welcome women, so her first majors were music and English. After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women.

A rock formation’s structure, composition, and location could tell you all \nsorts of things if you knew how to look at it.\n(line 55)    Studying the crack in the ocean floor, Tharp could see it was too large, too contiguous, (contiguous - near)\nto be anything but a rift valley, a place where two masses of land had separated. When she \ncompared it to a rift valley in Africa, she grew more certain. But when she showed Bruce \nHeezen, her research supervisor (four years her junior), “he groaned and said, ‘It cannot be. \nIt looks too much like continental drift,’ ” Tharp wrote later. “Bruce initially dismissed my\n(line 60) interpretation of the profiles as ‘girl talk.’ ” With the lab’s reputation on the line, Heezen \nordered her to redo the map. Tharp went back to the data and started plotting again from \nscratch. … \n   In late 1952, as Tharp was replotting the ocean floor, Heezen took on another deep-sea \nproject searching for safe places to plant transatlantic cables. He was creating his own map,\n(line 65) which plotted earthquake epicenters in the ocean floor. As his calculations accumulated, \nhe noticed something strange: Most quakes occurred in a nearly continuous line that sliced \ndown the center of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tharp had finished her second map— \na physiographic diagram giving the ocean floor a 3-D appearance—and sure enough, \nit showed the rift again. When Heezen and Tharp laid their two maps on top of each other\n(line 70) on a light table, both were stunned by how neatly the maps fit. The earthquake line \nthreaded right through Tharp’s valley. \n   They moved on from the Atlantic and began analyzing data from other oceans and other \nexpeditions, but the pattern kept repeating. They found additional mountain ranges, \nall seemingly connected and all split by rift valleys; within all of them, they found patterns\n(line 75) of earthquakes. “There was but one conclusion,” Tharp wrote. “The mountain range with \nits central valley was more or less a continuous feature across the face of the earth.” \nThe matter of whether their findings offered evidence of continental drift kept the pair \nsparring, but there was no denying they had made a monumental discovery: the mid-ocean \nridge, a 40,000-mile underwater mountain range that wraps around the globe like the seams \n(line 80) on a baseball.

The National Geographic Society commissioned Tharp and \nHeezen to make maps of the ocean floor and its features, helping laypeople (laypeople -non-scientists) visualize the \n(line 85) vast plates that allowed the earth’s crust to move. Throughout the 1960s, a slew of \ndiscoveries helped ideas such as seafloor spreading and plate tectonics gain acceptance, \nbringing with them a cascade of new theories about the way the planet and life on it had \nevolved.

After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women.

But the advent of sonar had \nchanged everything. For the first time, ships could “sound out” the precise depths of the \nocean below them. For five years, Tharp’s colleagues at Columbia University had been \ncrisscrossing the Atlantic, recording its depths. Women weren’t allowed on these research\n(line 10) trips—the lab director considered them bad luck at sea—so Tharp wasn’t on board. Instead, \nshe stayed in the lab, meticulously checking and plotting the ships’ raw findings, a mass of \ndata so large it was printed on a 5,000-foot scroll. As she charted the measurements by hand \non sheets of white linen, the floor of the ocean slowly took shape before her.\n   Tharp spent weeks creating a series of six parallel profiles of the Atlantic floor stretching \n(line 15) from east to west. Her drawings showed—for the first time—exactly where the continental \nshelf began to rise out of the abyssal plain (abyssal plain -the flat sea floor at a depth of 10,000 to 20,000 feet, generally adjacent to a continent) and where a large mountain range jutted from \nthe ocean floor. That range had been a shock when it was discovered in the 1870s by an \nexpedition testing routes for transatlantic telegraph cables, and it had remained the subject \nof speculation since; Tharp’s charting revealed its length and detail. \n(line 20)   Her maps also showed something else—something no one expected. Repeating in each \nwas “a deep notch near the crest of the ridge,” a V-shaped gap that seemed to run the entire \nlength of the mountain range. Tharp stared at it. It had to be a mistake.\n   She crunched and re-crunched the numbers for weeks on end, double- and triple-\nchecking her data. As she did, she became more convinced that the impossible was true:\n(line 25) She was looking at evidence of a rift valley, a place where magma emerged from inside the \nearth, forming new crust and thrusting the land apart. If her calculations were right, the \ngeosciences would never be the same. \n   A few decades before, a German geologist named Alfred Wegener had put forward \nthe radical theory that the continents of the earth had once been connected and had drifted\n(line 30) apart. In 1926, at a gathering of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, \nthe scientists in attendance rejected Wegener’s theory and mocked its maker. No force on \nEarth was thought powerful enough to move continents. “The dream of a great poet,” \nopined (opined -declared)  the director of the Geological Survey of France: “One tries to embrace it, and finds \nthat he has in his arms a little vapor or smoke.” Later, the president of the American\n(line 35) Philosophical Society deemed it “utter, damned rot!” \n   In the 1950s, as Tharp looked down at that tell-tale valley, Wegener’s theory was still \nconsidered verboten (verboten - forbidden) in the scientific community—even discussing it was tantamount to \nheresy. (tantamount to heresy - unacceptable) Almost all of Tharp’s colleagues, and practically every other scientist in the country, \ndismissed it; you could get fired for believing in it, she later recalled. \n(line 40)   But Tharp trusted what she’d seen. Though her job at Columbia was simply to plot and \nchart measurements, she had more training in geology than most plotters—more, in fact, \nthan some of the men she reported to. Tharp had grown up among rocks. Her father \nworked for the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, and as a child, she would accompany him as \nhe collected samples. But she never expected to be a mapmaker or even a scientist. At the\n(line 45) time, the fields didn’t welcome women, so her first majors were music and English. After \nPearl Harbor, however, universities opened up their departments. At the University of \nOhio, she discovered geology and found a mentor who encouraged her to take drafting. \nBecause Tharp was a woman, he told her, fieldwork was out of the question, but drafting \nexperience could help her get a job in an office like the one at Columbia. After graduating\n(line 50) from Ohio, she enrolled in a program at the University of Michigan, where, with men off \nfighting in the war, accelerated geology degrees were offered to women. There, Tharp \nbecame particularly fascinated with geomorphology, (geomorphology - the study of the physical features of the surfaces of the earth) devouring textbooks on how \nlandscapes form. A rock formation’s structure, composition, and location could tell you all \nsorts of things if you knew how to look at it.\n(line 55)    Studying the crack in the ocean floor, Tharp could see it was too large, too contiguous, (contiguous - near)\nto be anything but a rift valley, a place where two masses of land had separated. When she \ncompared it to a rift valley in Africa, she grew more certain. But when she showed Bruce \nHeezen, her research supervisor (four years her junior), “he groaned and said, ‘It cannot be. \nIt looks too much like continental drift,’ ” Tharp wrote later. “Bruce initially dismissed my\n(line 60) interpretation of the profiles as ‘girl talk.’ ” With the lab’s reputation on the line, Heezen \nordered her to redo the map. Tharp went back to the data and started plotting again from \nscratch. … \n   In late 1952, as Tharp was replotting the ocean floor, Heezen took on another deep-sea \nproject searching for safe places to plant transatlantic cables. He was creating his own map,\n(line 65) which plotted earthquake epicenters in the ocean floor. As his calculations accumulated, \nhe noticed something strange: Most quakes occurred in a nearly continuous line that sliced \ndown the center of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tharp had finished her second map— \na physiographic diagram giving the ocean floor a 3-D appearance—and sure enough, \nit showed the rift again. When Heezen and Tharp laid their two maps on top of each other\n(line 70) on a light table, both were stunned by how neatly the maps fit.

In a very short period of time, up to 27 inches of heavy snow fell. The snow damaged trees and power lines, shutting down electricity and blocking roads.\n(paragraph 3) This storm was the result of a phenomenon called “lake-effect snow.” It’s one of the main reasons why areas near big lakes, like the Great Lakes, get such remarkable snowstorms. Such storms usually occur between November and February, not October. It just so happened that all of the ingredients for lake-effect snow came together in a remarkable way that October.\n(paragraph 4) Lake-effect snow forms when cold air passes over the warmer waters of a lake. Water holds on to heat more than air. As a result, below freezing air often passes over much warmer water. This causes some lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. This warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. When it cools, it dumps all that moisture on the ground. If it’s cold enough, that moisture becomes snow.\n(paragraph 5) If the winds and temperatures are right, the air acts like a big sponge that sops up water from the lake and wrings it out on land. The direction of the wind is important—if the wind is blowing in a direction that covers more of the lake, the air will take in more water. The greater the temperature difference the more water the air will take in.\n(paragraph 6) All that water picked up from the lake normally travels no farther than about 25 miles away before falling, but it can sometimes travel as far as 100 miles away! That moisture can make for a whole lot of snow. Luckily for people living near large lakes, lake-effect snow generally slows down around February. That's when the lakes freeze over, making it impossible for the air to steal moisture away from the lake.\n(paragraph 7) Not surprisingly, Buffalo is one of the snowiest cities in the country.

Even though it was October, snow was falling faster than an inch per hour by the next afternoon.\nplummeted = fell quickly\nsqualls = strong gusts of wind\n(paragraph 2) The storm, called the “October Surprise” by locals, caught the Buffalo area off-guard. In a very short period of time, up to 27 inches of heavy snow fell. The snow damaged trees and power lines, shutting down electricity and blocking roads.\n(paragraph 3) This storm was the result of a phenomenon called “lake-effect snow.” It’s one of the main reasons why areas near big lakes, like the Great Lakes, get such remarkable snowstorms. Such storms usually occur between November and February, not October. It just so happened that all of the ingredients for lake-effect snow came together in a remarkable way that October.\n(paragraph 4) Lake-effect snow forms when cold air passes over the warmer waters of a lake. Water holds on to heat more than air. As a result, below freezing air often passes over much warmer water. This causes some lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. This warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. When it cools, it dumps all that moisture on the ground. If it’s cold enough, that moisture becomes snow.\n(paragraph 5) If the winds and temperatures are right, the air acts like a big sponge that sops up water from the lake and wrings it out on land. The direction of the wind is important—if the wind is blowing in a direction that covers more of the lake, the air will take in more water. The greater the temperature difference the more water the air will take in.\n(paragraph 6) All that water picked up from the lake normally travels no farther than about 25 miles away before falling, but it can sometimes travel as far as 100 miles away! That moisture can make for a whole lot of snow. Luckily for people living near large lakes, lake-effect snow generally slows down around February. That's when the lakes freeze over, making it impossible for the air to steal moisture away from the lake.\n(paragraph 7) Not surprisingly, Buffalo is one of the snowiest cities in the country. Conditions are frequently right for lake-effect snow. To many who live there, massive snowstorms are a regular part of life. But don't think you could get more snow days by moving to an area that experiences lake-effect snow. People there are well trained in snow removal!\n(image)[image-102.jpg]\nWhat is the meaning of the phrase “sops up” as it is used in paragraph 5?\n(A) pushes back\n(B) takes in\n(C) dries off\n(D) cools down\nAnswer:"}

Water holds on to heat more than air. As a result, below freezing air often passes over much warmer water. This causes some lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. This warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. When it cools, it dumps all that moisture on the ground. If it’s cold enough, that moisture becomes snow.\n(paragraph 5) If the winds and temperatures are right, the air acts like a big sponge that sops up water from the lake and wrings it out on land. The direction of the wind is important—if the wind is blowing in a direction that covers more of the lake, the air will take in more water.

Then answer questions 29 through 35.\n\nExcerpt from The Brooklyn Bridge: New York’s Graceful Connection\n\nby Vicki Weiner\n\n(image)[image-143.png]\n\n(paragraph 1) John Roebling was a native of Germany. After studying engineering at his country’s ﬁnest technical school, he came to the United States. It was 1831. Roebling was twenty-ﬁve years old. He wanted to put his skills and education to work. He and a group of fellow Germans purchased a large plot of land in Pennsylvania. The group built houses, stores, and churches on the land. They called their new farming town Saxonburg.\n\n(paragraph 2) Roebling found the farmer’s life too quiet, though. He told his son, Washington, that he longed to “employ science to useful purpose.” In the early 1840s, Roebling got his ﬁrst chance to do just that. He knew a new type of rope called wire cable was being used in Europe. It was made from iron wires. These wires were twisted together to form a long strand. Roebling made the ﬁrst iron wire cable in the United States.\n\n(paragraph 3) At ﬁrst, people doubted that Roebling’s cable could work better than rope. Once they tested it, though, they were amazed. The iron cable was thinner, stronger, and longer lasting than ordinary rope. Soon, delighted business owners were snatching up Roebling’s iron cables. They used the cables to haul heavy loads over Pennsylvania’s Allegheny Mountains.\n\n(paragraph 4) Roebling’s cable helped him create the modern suspension bridge. A suspension bridge spans a wide body of water. Ancient bridges were held up by rope made from hemp. Today’s bridges are held up by thick metal cables. The cables are attached to two strong towers, made of stone, steel, or iron. These towers hold the bridge in place. The roadway is suspended, or held up, by the cable.\n\n(paragraph 5) In 1861 the American Civil War began. John’s son, Washington, served in the Union Army. He even fought in the battle at Gettysburg. As a colonel, he built temporary suspension bridges using his father’s ideas. Washington soon became his father’s chief engineer.\n\n(paragraph 6) Together, father and son built many suspension bridges. One of their most famous works was built in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bridge spanned the Ohio River. At the time, in 1872, it was the largest suspension bridge ever seen. It was a triumph of engineering skills. Yet both father and son knew that harder work lay ahead. John Roebling never rested. He was an ambitious, driven man. Once he got an idea for a new bridge, he never forgot it.\n\n(paragraph 7) John Roebling ﬁrst presented his plan for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1867. His idea pleased many. Others thought Roebling’s bridge seemed unnecessary. New Yorkers didn’t go frequently to Brooklyn. To them, the project was a waste of money. On the other hand, Brooklyn’s residents were in favor of a bridge. Brooklyn was growing fast as a city. Its residents needed an easier way to travel to New York for work, school, shopping, and entertainment.\n\n(paragraph 8) Public opinion was divided. However, the terrible winter of 1866-67 swayed many city leaders’ minds. Icy conditions along the East River froze ferry service for days on end. This convinced Brooklyn’s mayor that the city couldn’t continue to grow without a bridge. Meanwhile, New Yorkers were warming to the idea, too. They knew that Brooklyn was booming. Still, it remained a cheaper and less crowded city than New York. It would be wonderful to have easy access to Brooklyn’s charms. On April 16, 1867, New York’s legislature created the New York Bridge Company. The company would be dedicated to Roebling’s dream—constructing a bridge over the East River. John Roebling was asked to be the bridge’s designer.\n\n(paragraph 9) Excitement about the bridge swelled. It was going to be unlike any structure seen before. Its length would measure 1,596 feet (486 m) from tower to tower. This would make it one-and-a-half times longer than the Cincinnati Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge's towers would feature 117-foot-high (35.7 m) Gothic arches. Horse and carriage riders would use outer lanes across the span. Trains would travel across the bridge's inner lanes. A special walkway, called a promenade, would be built above the roadways. Pedestrians, or people walking, would stroll across the promenade and be treated to magniﬁcent views of the city.\n\n(paragraph10) Everyone knew the completed bridge would be beautiful. However, many worried it would not be safe. Roebling invited a group of experts to study his plans. These experts were impressed with Roebling’s vision.

After studying engineering at his country’s ﬁnest technical school, he came to the United States. It was 1831. Roebling was twenty-ﬁve years old. He wanted to put his skills and education to work. He and a group of fellow Germans purchased a large plot of land in Pennsylvania. The group built houses, stores, and churches on the land. They called their new farming town Saxonburg.\n\n(paragraph 2) Roebling found the farmer’s life too quiet, though. He told his son, Washington, that he longed to “employ science to useful purpose.” In the early 1840s, Roebling got his ﬁrst chance to do just that. He knew a new type of rope called wire cable was being used in Europe. It was made from iron wires. These wires were twisted together to form a long strand. Roebling made the ﬁrst iron wire cable in the United States.\n\n(paragraph 3) At ﬁrst, people doubted that Roebling’s cable could work better than rope. Once they tested it, though, they were amazed. The iron cable was thinner, stronger, and longer lasting than ordinary rope. Soon, delighted business owners were snatching up Roebling’s iron cables. They used the cables to haul heavy loads over Pennsylvania’s Allegheny Mountains.\n\n(paragraph 4) Roebling’s cable helped him create the modern suspension bridge. A suspension bridge spans a wide body of water. Ancient bridges were held up by rope made from hemp. Today’s bridges are held up by thick metal cables. The cables are attached to two strong towers, made of stone, steel, or iron. These towers hold the bridge in place. The roadway is suspended, or held up, by the cable.\n\n(paragraph 5) In 1861 the American Civil War began. John’s son, Washington, served in the Union Army. He even fought in the battle at Gettysburg. As a colonel, he built temporary suspension bridges using his father’s ideas. Washington soon became his father’s chief engineer.\n\n(paragraph 6) Together, father and son built many suspension bridges. One of their most famous works was built in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bridge spanned the Ohio River. At the time, in 1872, it was the largest suspension bridge ever seen. It was a triumph of engineering skills. Yet both father and son knew that harder work lay ahead. John Roebling never rested. He was an ambitious, driven man. Once he got an idea for a new bridge, he never forgot it.\n\n(paragraph 7) John Roebling ﬁrst presented his plan for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1867. His idea pleased many. Others thought Roebling’s bridge seemed unnecessary. New Yorkers didn’t go frequently to Brooklyn. To them, the project was a waste of money. On the other hand, Brooklyn’s residents were in favor of a bridge. Brooklyn was growing fast as a city. Its residents needed an easier way to travel to New York for work, school, shopping, and entertainment.\n\n(paragraph 8) Public opinion was divided. However, the terrible winter of 1866-67 swayed many city leaders’ minds. Icy conditions along the East River froze ferry service for days on end. This convinced Brooklyn’s mayor that the city couldn’t continue to grow without a bridge. Meanwhile, New Yorkers were warming to the idea, too. They knew that Brooklyn was booming. Still, it remained a cheaper and less crowded city than New York. It would be wonderful to have easy access to Brooklyn’s charms. On April 16, 1867, New York’s legislature created the New York Bridge Company. The company would be dedicated to Roebling’s dream—constructing a bridge over the East River. John Roebling was asked to be the bridge’s designer.\n\n(paragraph 9) Excitement about the bridge swelled. It was going to be unlike any structure seen before. Its length would measure 1,596 feet (486 m) from tower to tower. This would make it one-and-a-half times longer than the Cincinnati Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge's towers would feature 117-foot-high (35.7 m) Gothic arches. Horse and carriage riders would use outer lanes across the span. Trains would travel across the bridge's inner lanes. A special walkway, called a promenade, would be built above the roadways. Pedestrians, or people walking, would stroll across the promenade and be treated to magniﬁcent views of the city.\n\n(paragraph10) Everyone knew the completed bridge would be beautiful. However, many worried it would not be safe. Roebling invited a group of experts to study his plans. These experts were impressed with Roebling’s vision.

He and a group of fellow Germans purchased a large plot of land in Pennsylvania. The group built houses, stores, and churches on the land. They called their new farming town Saxonburg.\n\n(paragraph 2) Roebling found the farmer’s life too quiet, though. He told his son, Washington, that he longed to “employ science to useful purpose.” In the early 1840s, Roebling got his ﬁrst chance to do just that. He knew a new type of rope called wire cable was being used in Europe. It was made from iron wires. These wires were twisted together to form a long strand. Roebling made the ﬁrst iron wire cable in the United States.\n\n(paragraph 3) At ﬁrst, people doubted that Roebling’s cable could work better than rope. Once they tested it, though, they were amazed. The iron cable was thinner, stronger, and longer lasting than ordinary rope. Soon, delighted business owners were snatching up Roebling’s iron cables. They used the cables to haul heavy loads over Pennsylvania’s Allegheny Mountains.\n\n(paragraph 4) Roebling’s cable helped him create the modern suspension bridge. A suspension bridge spans a wide body of water. Ancient bridges were held up by rope made from hemp. Today’s bridges are held up by thick metal cables. The cables are attached to two strong towers, made of stone, steel, or iron. These towers hold the bridge in place. The roadway is suspended, or held up, by the cable.\n\n(paragraph 5) In 1861 the American Civil War began. John’s son, Washington, served in the Union Army. He even fought in the battle at Gettysburg. As a colonel, he built temporary suspension bridges using his father’s ideas. Washington soon became his father’s chief engineer.\n\n(paragraph 6) Together, father and son built many suspension bridges. One of their most famous works was built in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bridge spanned the Ohio River. At the time, in 1872, it was the largest suspension bridge ever seen. It was a triumph of engineering skills. Yet both father and son knew that harder work lay ahead. John Roebling never rested. He was an ambitious, driven man. Once he got an idea for a new bridge, he never forgot it.\n\n(paragraph 7) John Roebling ﬁrst presented his plan for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1867. His idea pleased many. Others thought Roebling’s bridge seemed unnecessary. New Yorkers didn’t go frequently to Brooklyn. To them, the project was a waste of money. On the other hand, Brooklyn’s residents were in favor of a bridge. Brooklyn was growing fast as a city. Its residents needed an easier way to travel to New York for work, school, shopping, and entertainment.\n\n(paragraph 8) Public opinion was divided. However, the terrible winter of 1866-67 swayed many city leaders’ minds. Icy conditions along the East River froze ferry service for days on end. This convinced Brooklyn’s mayor that the city couldn’t continue to grow without a bridge. Meanwhile, New Yorkers were warming to the idea, too. They knew that Brooklyn was booming. Still, it remained a cheaper and less crowded city than New York. It would be wonderful to have easy access to Brooklyn’s charms. On April 16, 1867, New York’s legislature created the New York Bridge Company. The company would be dedicated to Roebling’s dream—constructing a bridge over the East River. John Roebling was asked to be the bridge’s designer.\n\n(paragraph 9) Excitement about the bridge swelled. It was going to be unlike any structure seen before. Its length would measure 1,596 feet (486 m) from tower to tower. This would make it one-and-a-half times longer than the Cincinnati Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge's towers would feature 117-foot-high (35.7 m) Gothic arches. Horse and carriage riders would use outer lanes across the span. Trains would travel across the bridge's inner lanes. A special walkway, called a promenade, would be built above the roadways. Pedestrians, or people walking, would stroll across the promenade and be treated to magniﬁcent views of the city.\n\n(paragraph10) Everyone knew the completed bridge would be beautiful. However, many worried it would not be safe. Roebling invited a group of experts to study his plans. These experts were impressed with Roebling’s vision.

Please only respond with the letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponding to the correct answer, without any additional explanation.\n\n\nBase your answers to questions 48 through 50 on the passage and map below and on your knowledge of Earth science. The map shows the location of the Marcellus shale formation in New York State.\n\nThe Marcellus Shale\nThe Marcellus shale is a black shale formation that was formed during the Middle Devonian Period. The shale extends from New York State as far south as Alabama. The Marcellus shale is exposed at the surface in the northern Finger Lakes region, and is buried 2.1 kilometers below the surface along the New York-Pennsylvania border.\n\nGeologists estimate that the Marcellus shale contains hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Most of the Marcellus shale does not allow fluids (gases and liquids) to flow through the rock. In order to obtain the natural gas trapped in the rock, the shale is fractured. This hydraulic fracturing consists of drilling a well, then pumping in large amounts of water containing chemicals and sand under high pressure to create cracks in the gas-bearing rock. Although this process can allow the trapped gas to be removed from the shale, opponents of hydraulic fracturing argue that the chemicals used in the process may lead to groundwater contamination.\n\nMarcellus Shale Formation in New York State\n(image)[image-798.png]\nWhy might people living near Elmira, New York, be opposed to energy companies using the hydraulic fracturing process?\n(A) It could lower their energy costs\n(B) The injected water could cause flooding in the area.\n(C) There is the potential for the pollution of groundwater.\n(D) There is an increased risk of volcanic activity.\nAnswer:"}

Be ready to share one of your family's customs, tomorrow.\"\n(paragraph 3) After school, Yasmeen dragged her backpack along, thinking about the day's assignment. \"I'm the only Indian student in my class,\" she thought, \"what will everyone think about my family's customs?\"\n(paragraph 4) At home, Yasmeen moped through the kitchen door. Her heart fluttered when she saw her amma, her mother, busily crushing henna leaves.\n(paragraph 5) \"How was school today?\" her amma asked, in her soft Indian accent.\n(paragraph 6) \"Fine\", Yasmeen said. She dropped her backpack and slid into a kitchen chair.\n(paragraph 7) \"Ready for Eid-ul-Fitr tonight?\" Amma smiled.\n(paragraph 8) Yasmeen shrugged. Normally, shed be tickled with excitement inside when her aunts, uncles and cousins came to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic year. This holy month is observed with prayers and fasting during daylight hours.\n(paragraph 9) Yasmeen slid down further in her seat. She twirled a strand of her long hair around her finger, while Amma crushed more leaves into a powder. \"What am I going to share tomorrow?\" Yasmeen wondered.\n(paragraph 10) Later, Yasmeen explored the house, trying to find an idea for her assignment. She found her abba's Koran. She flipped through the worn pages of her father's leather-bound book. Maybe I'll take this to school, she thought.\n(paragraph 11) But then she shook her head. The Koran isn't a custom. She carefully laid down the holy book. Anyway, Abba would never let me take it to school.\n(paragraph 12) A beautiful salwar kameez hung on Amma's bedroom door. Salwar kameez is a long-sleeved shirt and baggy pants, with a thin, silky shawl. All three are ornately decorated with sparkling beads, sequins and colorful embroidery, in a variety of colors. The colorful sequins and beads on Amma's dress and shawl glistened. Tonight, Amma would wear her new dress to the party.\n(paragraph 13) Maybe I'll wear my salwar kameez to school. Wrong! Everybody might laugh at me. Tears filled Yasmeen's deep brown eyes as she tried to figure out what to share.\n(paragraph 14) Yasmeen walked into the kitchen. Leaning in the doorway, she wiped a tear from her cheek. She watched Amma stir henna powder into a smooth paste, adding lemon juice and tamarind water. Amma then filled cones with the henna paste, to be used at the party.\n(paragraph 15) Yasmeen coiled her hair around her pinkie. I'll ask Tahira. She'll know what I can share, she thought.\n(paragraph 16) \"I have to share a family custom tomorrow\", Yasmeen said, peeking into her older sister's bedroom. Her eyes explored the top of Tahira's dresser. It overflowed with sparkling earrings and necklaces. Mixed among the other jewelry, golden bangles shimmered.\n(paragraph 17) \"Show some jewelry\", Tahira suggested, jangling several shiny bangles on her wrist.\n(paragraph 18) \"I guess\", Yasmeen said, tugging at strands of her hair. \"Except, everybody wears jewelry.\"\n(paragraph 19) That night at the party the aroma of herbs from the henna filled the living room. All the girls and ladies in their glittering dresses gathered around the sofa to visit and have their hands painted with mehndi (henna paste).\n(paragraph 20) It was Yasmeen's turn. With a cone of henna paste, Amma painted tiny flowers, paisley designs, and intricate patterns on Yasmeen's hands.\n(image)[image-910.jpg]\n(paragraph 21) Seconds later, Yasmeen sat straight up. \"That's it\", she blurted out, \"Mehndi!\"\n(paragraph 22) At school the next day, Yasmeen waited for her turn to share. Her face didn't blush. She didn't even feel hot. I'm not nervous anymore, she thought. With a wide smile, Yasmeen stood before the class.\n(paragraph 23) \"On special Muslim holidays\", Yasmeen explained, \"it's an Indian tradition to paint women's hands with intricate mehndi designs. Last night, my mother painted my hands.\" Yasmeen proudly displayed the delicate curly cues, tiny flowers, and paisley patterns on her hands. Yasmeen also held up a bowl of crushed henna leaves and a henna-filled cone, for the class to see. Yasmeen then described how her mother prepared henna paste.\n(paragraph 24) \"Could you paint a mehndi design on my hand?\" Mrs. Cross asked.\n(paragraph 25) Yasmeen felt herself gasp at Mrs. Cross's question.

Be ready to share one of your family's customs, tomorrow.\"\n(paragraph 3) After school, Yasmeen dragged her backpack along, thinking about the day's assignment. \"I'm the only Indian student in my class,\" she thought, \"what will everyone think about my family's customs?\"\n(paragraph 4) At home, Yasmeen moped through the kitchen door. Her heart fluttered when she saw her amma, her mother, busily crushing henna leaves.\n(paragraph 5) \"How was school today?\" her amma asked, in her soft Indian accent.\n(paragraph 6) \"Fine\", Yasmeen said. She dropped her backpack and slid into a kitchen chair.\n(paragraph 7) \"Ready for Eid-ul-Fitr tonight?\" Amma smiled.\n(paragraph 8) Yasmeen shrugged. Normally, shed be tickled with excitement inside when her aunts, uncles and cousins came to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic year. This holy month is observed with prayers and fasting during daylight hours.\n(paragraph 9) Yasmeen slid down further in her seat. She twirled a strand of her long hair around her finger, while Amma crushed more leaves into a powder. \"What am I going to share tomorrow?\" Yasmeen wondered.\n(paragraph 10) Later, Yasmeen explored the house, trying to find an idea for her assignment. She found her abba's Koran. She flipped through the worn pages of her father's leather-bound book. Maybe I'll take this to school, she thought.\n(paragraph 11) But then she shook her head. The Koran isn't a custom. She carefully laid down the holy book. Anyway, Abba would never let me take it to school.\n(paragraph 12) A beautiful salwar kameez hung on Amma's bedroom door. Salwar kameez is a long-sleeved shirt and baggy pants, with a thin, silky shawl. All three are ornately decorated with sparkling beads, sequins and colorful embroidery, in a variety of colors. The colorful sequins and beads on Amma's dress and shawl glistened. Tonight, Amma would wear her new dress to the party.\n(paragraph 13) Maybe I'll wear my salwar kameez to school. Wrong! Everybody might laugh at me. Tears filled Yasmeen's deep brown eyes as she tried to figure out what to share.\n(paragraph 14) Yasmeen walked into the kitchen. Leaning in the doorway, she wiped a tear from her cheek. She watched Amma stir henna powder into a smooth paste, adding lemon juice and tamarind water. Amma then filled cones with the henna paste, to be used at the party.\n(paragraph 15) Yasmeen coiled her hair around her pinkie. I'll ask Tahira. She'll know what I can share, she thought.\n(paragraph 16) \"I have to share a family custom tomorrow\", Yasmeen said, peeking into her older sister's bedroom. Her eyes explored the top of Tahira's dresser. It overflowed with sparkling earrings and necklaces. Mixed among the other jewelry, golden bangles shimmered.\n(paragraph 17) \"Show some jewelry\", Tahira suggested, jangling several shiny bangles on her wrist.\n(paragraph 18) \"I guess\", Yasmeen said, tugging at strands of her hair. \"Except, everybody wears jewelry.\"\n(paragraph 19) That night at the party the aroma of herbs from the henna filled the living room. All the girls and ladies in their glittering dresses gathered around the sofa to visit and have their hands painted with mehndi (henna paste).\n(paragraph 20) It was Yasmeen's turn. With a cone of henna paste, Amma painted tiny flowers, paisley designs, and intricate patterns on Yasmeen's hands.\n(image)[image-910.jpg]\n(paragraph 21) Seconds later, Yasmeen sat straight up. \"That's it\", she blurted out, \"Mehndi!\"\n(paragraph 22) At school the next day, Yasmeen waited for her turn to share. Her face didn't blush. She didn't even feel hot. I'm not nervous anymore, she thought. With a wide smile, Yasmeen stood before the class.\n(paragraph 23) \"On special Muslim holidays\", Yasmeen explained, \"it's an Indian tradition to paint women's hands with intricate mehndi designs. Last night, my mother painted my hands.\" Yasmeen proudly displayed the delicate curly cues, tiny flowers, and paisley patterns on her hands. Yasmeen also held up a bowl of crushed henna leaves and a henna-filled cone, for the class to see. Yasmeen then described how her mother prepared henna paste.\n(paragraph 24) \"Could you paint a mehndi design on my hand?\" Mrs. Cross asked.\n(paragraph 25) Yasmeen felt herself gasp at Mrs. Cross's question. Her mouth opened and stayed open as classmates held out their hands. \"Me, too! Will you draw on my hands, too?\"\n(paragraph 26) \"And mine!\"\n(paragraph 27) \"Mine, too!\"\n(paragraph 28) Yasmeen's feet danced her home, her hands waving in the air to lead the way. The spicy scent of tamarind and henna flled her nose. \"Amma! Amma! You will never believe what happened today.\"\nIn paragraph 25, the narrator explains that Yasmeen \"felt herself gasp\" to show that Yasmeen feels\n(A) surprised by the teacher's response\n(B) nervous about what will happen next\n(C) confused by her classmates' requests\n(D) afraid to tell her parents about what happened\nAnswer:"}
